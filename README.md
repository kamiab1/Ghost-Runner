### Our proposal:

***Ghost Runner***: the anonymous running platform with a competitive edge. Similar to racing games, previously recorded runs will be represented as “ghosts”, or colored dots on the map, as if running beside you. These recorded runs may come from both the user themself and anonymously from the user base. The user would be able to select a “target pace” that would be displayed in a time-interval UI element. This would display the user’s time split for each section of their run, pairing the number with a color feedback (the overall accent color of the UI would shift between red-blue-green; below pace, on pace, and above pace, respectively). Thus, this app would serve the purpose of a highly customizable, self-paced personal trainer via the time-interval UI, as well as bringing the competitive excitement of racing against other “ghosts” on the map.

The core of the app lies in our algorithm, which would take the geo-data and time-stamps and compute a “run”, which would be split up into adjustable sectors. The user would receive audio-visual feedback on their performance relative to these sectors. This algorithm would ideally be able to tackle short runs, long runs, and runs through difficult-to-predict terrain, providing a consistent user experience for all running goals and fitness levels.
